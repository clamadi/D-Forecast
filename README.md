# D-Forecast


## Description
This challenge was designed to allow the developer build a weather dashboard using an external API and adding functionality of saving search history and displaying the five day forecast beside the current day.

In the course of this challenge i learnt the use of API. Although this challenge hasn't been completed to meet all the acceptance criteria as i haven't implemented the 5-day forecast and history functionality of the page. I still intend to revisit this challenge to figure out how i can fix this.

## Application
* [D-Forecast Repository](https://github.com/clamadi/D-Forecast)
* [D-Forecast Webpage](https://clamadi.github.io/D-Forecast/)

## How to Use
To run this web page, right click on the index.html file and open on a browser of your choice.
Type in the city you will like to view its weather details and click on the search key.

The image below gives you a sample of what you will see on the page.
